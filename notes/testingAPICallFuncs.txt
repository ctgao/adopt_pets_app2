Now let's get into testing functions that have API calls within them.

The example in this app is useBreedList, which uses fetchBreedList, which class fetch on an API endpoint.
If we were to write a test that directly tests this, we'd be hitting this API super frequently that we
would probably end up getting rate-limited or timed-out for suspicious behavior, or something along those
lines. In order to combat that, let's MOCK that.

Mocking will let us take over an input/output of a function for the purposes of test. It leaves nothing
up to chance and allows us to test only the snippet that we care about, not the snippet AND its subsequent
calls.
