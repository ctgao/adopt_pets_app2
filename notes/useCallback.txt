useCallback() notes

It uses the useRef() example we saw before with the rotating cube. We import it in, re-use the code
from the red dot moving left and right to see how smoothly it runs??? A little unsure atm.

Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.

The component that you're using for useCallback MUST BE wrapped in memo in its original definition.
By using useCallback and useRef, we avoid having to render the component over and over again. With
useRef, that stops the component itself from re-rendering, unless its state changes. With useCallback,
the component will cache the function definition between re-renders, making it speeeedy.
