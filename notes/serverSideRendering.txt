Server Side Rendering

Right now what's happening is that when the app loads, the empty index.html file that we've provided gets
sent over FIRST. This then shows the user a blank page before the rest of the content gets fetched and
loaded in. Server Side Rendering is meant to combat that. We want to send the user the COMPLETED initial
HTML file, hoping that once the user makes a decision and is ready to interact with our website, the
website will be READY!!!

Can't do DOM stuff in Node.js! Therefore we use StaticRoute -> a Router that can be used inside of Node.js.

renderToPipeableStream() allows us to send over pieces of info as they're render ready.

Problem is: Node.js can't ready JSX files. That's why we have to do it like this?

NEW NOTES: We did it the JANKY way, but there is a legit way to do this.
Imagine if when we load the page, EVERYTHING gets loaded in at once. We can DO THAT with server side rendering.
This is particularly useful in cases where a "round-trip" AKA trying to load this webpage on somewhere far,
far away like Mars, when you refresh the page, you don't have to re-fetch. You'd essentially pull from a cache
to get all the pets. This would send the request in GIANT payload.
