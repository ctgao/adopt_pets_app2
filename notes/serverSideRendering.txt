Server Side Rendering

Right now what's happening is that when the app loads, the empty index.html file that we've provided gets
sent over FIRST. This then shows the user a blank page before the rest of the content gets fetched and
loaded in. Server Side Rendering is meant to combat that. We want to send the user the COMPLETED initial
HTML file, hoping that once the user makes a decision and is ready to interact with our website, the
website will be READY!!!

Can't do DOM stuff in Node.js! Therefore we use StaticRoute -> a Router that can be used inside of Node.js.

renderToPipeableStream() allows us to send over pieces of info as they're render ready.

Problem is: Node.js can't ready JSX files. That's why we have to do it like this?
