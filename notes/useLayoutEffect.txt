useLayoutEffect() notes

A very NICHE case. I want to measure something, only after it has been rendered. For example, a resizeable
textarea. Using useLayoutEffect over useEffect means that you don't have to see the little glitches that
happen when you're in the middle of resizing.

componentDidMount() from class components === useLayoutEffect() from function components
