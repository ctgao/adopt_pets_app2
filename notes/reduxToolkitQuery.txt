There's React Query, what we've been using before to do our queries (API calls). Redux Toolkit has their own
version of this. Brian Holt's recommendation is that if you're gonna use Redux Toolkit, go HARD and use the
Redux Toolkit Query as well!

Notes: The types here are CONFUSING AF!!! I refuse using Typescript and the RTK Query stuff for now because
I really don't think I have sufficient information and understanding of this.

We don't have to do this, but we put a middleware in (just the default middleware is fine), this will help
us cache all of our api responses. It does exactly what React Query was doing with the caching as well.
