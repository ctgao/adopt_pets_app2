What is a slice for Redux Toolkit?

Putting all the reducers and action creators in this bundle together and that is this SLICE concept.

A reducer is a function that takes in an old-state and an action. It performs that action and that generally
modifies the old-state and returns the new-state.

Whenever you create a reducer, you automatically get an action created for you (by Redux). This is the action
that gets sent into the reducer to "modify" the old-state.
