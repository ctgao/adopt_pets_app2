If you're trying to write typescript, you have to INCLUDE TYPES!!! Since React is written in JavaScript.
Some IDEs, like VSCode (I think IntelliJ does this too) will run Typescript on your Javascript code
naturally. However, if you hover over non-library code (aka stuff we've written), then you'll notice a
distinct lack of types. Since we didn't specify types, then most of the stuff shows up as just 'any' type.

When modifying existing Javascript over to Typescript, often times you'll see type-checking if-statements.
This helps Typescript narrow down the types that variables can be so we can ensure our code is SAFE!!!

How to decide what files to migrate over? Choose LEAF nodes!!! 'Typing' Modal is good since it depends
on nothing else. Once you're done, you're DONE!!! Doesn't really matter how you migrate, it's just choice.

If you're using ESLint, you also have to get the typescript plugin so it can recognize all the : colons.
"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking" This plugin REQUIRES ALL TYPE CHECKING!
This is good to add at the end of completing your project so that the people who pick up your work have to
enforce type checking as well.
