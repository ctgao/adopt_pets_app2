useImperativeHandle is for when the child of a component needs to [pass information back to the parent.

useDebugValue is for when people make custom hooks and use a debug value to log out a value associated
with the custom hook so you know.

useInsertionEffect is usually for libraries and this happens BEFORE RENDER.

Pretty much all of these are use case types. These solve very NICHE problems that Meta AKA Facebook
has encountered.
