useTransition() notes

What this is supposed to do is give you a buffer while the content is loading. When we click a button, we
don't want to allow the user to click the "Submit" button multiple times (could break our App if done in
quick succession) and we want them to see that we're loading their content in soon enough.

This is low-priority AND it shows an intermediary so the user knows that the webpage is responsive.

In the example we did with our code, it doesn't really work because requestParams is not a state that when
change happens, must get re-rendered. Therefore, useTransition function isn't able to do anything because
there's nothing to re-render.

NOW HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE!!!
useTransition function is more for when you KNOW something new is going to be heavy and therefore low-priority.
useDeferredValue function is for when you JUST received something and you're saying "take your time rendering".
